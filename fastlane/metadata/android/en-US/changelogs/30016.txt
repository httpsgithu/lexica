French dictionary improvements (thanks to input from @mccoys):
 * Improved board selection: Probabilities now calculated from the frequency with which letters occur in the dictionary.
 * Removed letters à, ö, ü, ë: Each occur in less than 50 words, typically in loanwords.
 * Q is always followed by u.
