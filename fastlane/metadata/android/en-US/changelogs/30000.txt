Better multiplayer support (thanks to ecrips):

* Fixes boards containing "Qu".
* Hides contents of the board to eager eyes when sharing via SMS.
* WARNING: Multiplayer games from v3+ will cause older versions to crash. Upgrade to play against newer versions. Future enhancements will ask players to upgrade instead of crashing.

Translations updated.
