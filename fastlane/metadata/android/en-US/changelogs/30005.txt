Introducing the web version of Lexica!

Special thanks to @MattRCole for such a huge effort bringing this to life!

Multiplayer invites now include links to the new (beta) web version for those without Android devices. The QR code shown when starting a new multiplayer game can also show a URL to the web version.

Please provide feedback/report issues at https://github.com/lexica/lexica/issues.
