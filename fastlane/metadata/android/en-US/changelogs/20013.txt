Improvements:

* Prompt for confirmation prior to ending game, reducing the likelihood that you accidentally end a game in error (Thanks to all who provided their input on this issue on GitHub).
* Black navigation bar on dark and high contrast themes.

Bugfix:

* Refresh the theme of the main menu after changing themes (all other screens updated as expected).
