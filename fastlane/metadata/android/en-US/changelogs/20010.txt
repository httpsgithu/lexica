Multiplayer improvement:
 * Show how many words in the board prior to inviting others or joining a game.
 * If you prefer more or less words for your multiplayer game, you can now refresh the board prior to playing.

Bug fix:
 * Consecutive sound effects now play as expected (One of the oldest reported bugs, from 2017, thanks for the report PakoPakoJr!)
