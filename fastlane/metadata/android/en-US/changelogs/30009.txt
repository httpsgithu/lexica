Added Indonesia translation (thanks to liimee) and updated others (thanks as always to the community of translators).

Fix (thanks to hhpmmd):
 * German scores 6 points for letter "v" (previously was accidentally scoring 1).

Minor UI changes:
 * Due to a no-longer supported library used to render buttons. Required more changes than expected, hence the minor bump to 3.7.x.
