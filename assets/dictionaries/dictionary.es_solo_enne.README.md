This dictionary is generated from previous dictionary.es.txt 

Some generative scripts are in the root folder:
spanish-translit-utf8.sed transliterates accented letters.

This dictionary removes accents (áéíóú>aeiou), as it is in Spanish crosswords (at least on the ones published in Spain).
Eñe (N with tilde) is respected, since it is in Spanish crosswords.
Ü (u with umlaut) is changed to U, as in Spanish crosswords. Please note some Scrabble versions respect the umlaut.

Rationale:
Spanish words can have zero or one acute accents, but they can have any number of N with tilde.
They can also have any number of u with umlaut, but it is very rare character.
